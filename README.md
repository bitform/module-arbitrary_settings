## Arbitrary Settings module

The Arbitrary Settings module is something of an oddity. Unlike the other modules, it doesn't directly DO anything with
Form Tools: all it does it let you add a section at the bottom of the Settings -> Main tab, where you can define you own
settings for storage in the Form Tools database. What do those settings contain and do? Anything you want.
